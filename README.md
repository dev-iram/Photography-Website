## Assignment Brief

You have left your previous employer at and have embarked on a new career path where you have signed up to a web development course.  
Part of the course will be designing a website of your choice. Although you get to pick the topic, you are required to work to certain standards. The website must be built with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

You have been provided with the following information and you must ensure the website has a “clean” look and feel. 

Navigation Menu
A Navigation menu displayed along the top of the page with a minimum of 5 pages made up of at least a Home page, Information page about your topic, an About (about you), a Contacts page and an Image Gallery page.  All pages need to be separate pages and the website must allow navigation to all the pages. Use of the <NAV> is required.

Home Page - Slider
The home page will start with a “slider “which shows off at least 3 images, you must add some content blocks and style these pages with CSS3. Include at least on type of animation.
To fill the spaces with text content (you are welcome to use Lorem Ipsum text).

Information Page
Information page should have some basic text (you are welcome to use Lorem Ipsum text) and requires an embedded video of a promotional video of your topic. (You may use a random video clip if it has something to do with your topic.)
The information page will also require a table, (you are welcome to use Lorem Ipsum text) and the table needs to be styled with CSS with alternative colours per row (2 colours in total). Header needs to be styled with the general colours of her website, also the alternative rows need to be styled as well as the hover row to make it easier for the visitor to visually identify rows.


Image Gallery Page
On the Image Gallery page you need to have at least 10 images formatted and styled in a presentable format. Use a JQuery Lightbox to allow the web visitor to get a good view of the images.

Contact Page
The contacts page needs to have a form, which allows the end user to send you an email. The form must include the following fields:  first name, last name, telephone number, email address and subject. The form must work/function
As the user enters the data, you will need to validate the data being entered via a JavaScript and give feedback to the user. Use error messages for incorrect entries 

About Page
This page should have some information about you, which would market your skills in a positive light

Frameworks may be used. All web pages need to be use the same CSS source files. Each page needs to use 3 types of CSS sources. At least 1 element per page will need to be styled Inline, some internal and most external. Approximately 90% of the CSS should be in an external file with the remaining 9% internal. 
Maintain best practices in keeping your web content files in various folders.
Images -> assets folder
CSS -> css folder
Javascript -> js folder
It is important to demonstrate various skills that you have learnt from the course and you can add elements that you believe will make your design stand out.
